# Hexapod

The ultimate purpose for the hexapod is to be able to walk in multiple terrains.
I've been working on this for 2 years now and everything has been done from scratch apart from the servo control library and the IDEs used.
For a video introduction and guide watch the videos below:

    Here I am tackling the legs

## Diagrams
[in Leg.ino](https://github.com/marcuscw/Hexapod/blob/main/HexapodESP32/Leg.ino) I have code for the inverse kinematics however all the variable names are very vague so here are some diagrams to help you identify which is which.
